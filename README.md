# FlashCards!

## Abstract
The end goal of this project is to have a functional flashcard app that logs incorrect guesses, cycles through the flashcards, gives feedback on individual responses, and returns the final correct guess percentage at the end of the game.


## Learning Goals
- Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
- Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
- Implement ES6 classes
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

### Wins
- I now feel comfortable writing tests
- I went from no practice with arrow functions to a good level of understanding
- I implemented my first iterator method in code
- I really pushed my boundaries working with so many co-dependent classes

### Challenges
- I was unable to get my collection of classes to form a functioning game by the project deadline
